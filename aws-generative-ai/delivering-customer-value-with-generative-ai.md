# Delivering Customer Value with Generative AI

**üåü Overview**

* Generative AI represents a significant technological advancement, enhancing customer experiences, transforming operations, improving employee productivity, and creating new revenue channels.
* It extends the power of machine learning (ML), allowing companies to create new content (text, images, video, audio, code) and revolutionize IT through foundation model (FM) training and data curation instead of traditional coding.

**üìà Importance of Generative AI**

* Generative AI's broad applicability and powerful results make it a focus for business leaders.
* Gartner predicts that by 2026, over 80% of enterprises will have used generative AI APIs or deployed generative AI-enabled applications.
* Many AWS customers are expected to transition from proof-of-concept (PoC) to production, generating business value.

**ü§ù Role of AWS Partners**

* AWS Partners should work with customers early to develop generative AI strategies.
* Partners can guide customers through changes and empower them to leverage generative AI's potential, enabling new business capabilities and models.
* The goal is to provide insights and support to help customers navigate the evolving landscape and choose AWS for generative AI and ML.

**üõ†Ô∏è Unique Considerations for Generative AI Adoption**

Customers need to tackle three key considerations:

1. **What to build**
2. **How to build**
3. **How to scale**

AWS surveys and interviews identify seven key challenges across these three questions:

**What to Build**

1. **Technology**
2. **Early Adoption**

**How to Build**

3. **Data**
4. **Architectural Options**
5. **Legal and Cybersecurity**

**How to Scale**

6. **Day 2 Operations**
7. **Organizational Change Management**

**üöÄ Time for Change is Now**

* Generative AI is disrupting all industries, making it crucial for organizations to evaluate its use.
* The significant commercial interest in generative AI in 2023 indicates immediate and future business opportunities for partners.
* Delaying generative AI planning and implementation poses risks, including competitive disadvantage and remaining stuck in the proof-of-concept phase.

**üíº Business Opportunities and Risks**

* **Significant Commercial Interest:** $18B in venture capital funding for generative AI in 2023 and a projected 7% GDP rise due to generative AI (Goldman Sachs, 2023).
