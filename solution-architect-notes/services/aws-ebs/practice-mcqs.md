    * D. sc1 is for infrequently accessed data.
93. **Question**: What is the primary benefit of Elastic Volumes?

    * A. Automatic data replication
    * B. Dynamic resizing without downtime
    * C. Enhanced data encryption
    * D. Improved data durability

    **Answer**: B. Dynamic resizing without downtime **Explanation**: Elastic Volumes allow you to change the size, performance, and type of your EBS volumes without detaching them from your instances. **Incorrect Options**:

    * A. Data replication is managed separately.
    * C. Encryption is handled by AWS KMS.
    * D. Data durability is an inherent feature of EBS.
94. **Question**: How does I/O bursting work for gp3 volumes?

    * A. By automatically replicating data across multiple AZs
    * B. By temporarily providing higher IOPS using I/O credits
    * C. By encrypting data at rest
    * D. By providing continuous high throughput

    **Answer**: B. By temporarily providing higher IOPS using I/O credits **Explanation**: gp3 volumes accumulate I/O credits when the volume's IOPS are below the baseline, allowing them to burst up to 16,000 IOPS. **Incorrect Options**:

    * A. Data replication is managed separately.
    * C. Encryption is handled by AWS KMS.
    * D. High throughput is related to st1 volumes.
95. **Question**: What is a common misconception about General Purpose SSD (gp3) volumes?

    * A. They provide consistent, high IOPS
    * B. They can burst to higher IOPS using I/O credits
    * C. They are suitable for a broad range of workloads
    * D. They have a baseline performance of 3,000 IOPS

    **Answer**: A. They provide consistent, high IOPS **Explanation**: gp3 volumes provide a baseline performance of 3,000 IOPS and can burst to higher IOPS using I/O credits, but they do not offer the consistent high IOPS of io2 volumes. **Incorrect Options**:

    * B. Correct understanding, they can burst using I/O credits.
    * C. Correct understanding, they are suitable for a broad range of workloads.
    * D. Correct understanding, they have a baseline of 3,000 IOPS.

**EBS Multi-Attach**

96. **Question**: Which EBS volume type supports the Multi-Attach feature?

    * A. General Purpose SSD (gp3)
    * B. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
    * C. Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
    * D. Cold HDD (sc1)

    **Answer**: B. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) **Explanation**: Multi-Attach is only available for io2 volumes, allowing them to be attached to multiple instances simultaneously. **Incorrect Options**:

    * A. gp3 does not support Multi-Attach.
    * C. st1 does not support Multi-Attach.
    * D. sc1 does not support Multi-Attach.
97. **Question**: What is a suitable use case for EBS Multi-Attach?

    * A. Archival storage
    * B. High-availability clustered databases
    * C. Log processing
    * D. Low-latency interactive applications

    **Answer**: B. High-availability clustered databases **Explanation**: Multi-Attach is ideal for high-availability clustered databases, allowing multiple instances to access the same volume. **Incorrect Options**:

    * A. Archival storage does not require Multi-Attach.
    * C. Log processing does not typically require Multi-Attach.
    * D. Low-latency applications use gp3 or io2 but do not necessarily need Multi-Attach.
98. **Question**: What is a common misconception about EBS Multi-Attach?

    * A. It is only available for io2 volumes.
    * B. It allows multiple instances to access a single volume.
    * C. It improves read/write performance.
    * D. It is suitable for clustered applications.

    **Answer**: C. It improves read/write performance. **Explanation**: Multi-Attach allows multiple instances to access a single volume, but it does not inherently improve read/write performance. **Incorrect Options**:

    * A. Correct understanding, it is only available for io2.
    * B. Correct understanding, it allows multiple instances to access a single volume.
    * D. Correct understanding, it is suitable for clustered applications.
99. **Question**: Which AWS service can be used to automate the management of EBS snapshots for Multi-Attach volumes?

    * A. AWS CloudTrail
    * B. AWS Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)
    * C. AWS Config
    * D. AWS KMS

    **Answer**: B. AWS Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) **Explanation**: DLM can automate the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS snapshots, including those for Multi-Attach volumes. **Incorrect Options**:

    * A. CloudTrail logs API calls but does not manage snapshots.
    * C. Config tracks resource configurations but does not manage snapshots.
    * D. KMS manages encryption keys, not snapshots.
